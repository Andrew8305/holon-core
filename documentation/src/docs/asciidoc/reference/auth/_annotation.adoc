=== @Authenticate annotation

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/auth/annotations/Authenticate.html[Authenticate^] can be used on classes or methods to require authentication for resource access.

The support for this annotation must be documented and it is available for other modules of the Holon platform.

The annotation supports optional *schemes* specification to provide the allowed authentication schemes to be used to perform principal authentication, and an optional *redirectURI* which can be used to redirect user interaction when the authentication succeeds or fails (the semantic and behaviour associated to the redirect URI is specific for every authentication delegate).
