== Introduction

The Holon Platform *Core* module represents the platform foundation, providing the definition of the overall architecture, base structures and APIs.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

== What's new in version 5.1.x

* The `PropertySet` interface now supports _identifier_ properties declaration, which can be used to provide a virtual primary key to distinguish a `PropertyBox` instance from another (using the _identifier_ property values), both at Java objects level (`equals` and `hashCode`) and at persistence architecture level.

== Core API, services and components

=== Introduction

The `holon-core` artifact is the Holon platform *core* API and implementation asset, defining and providing the main platform architecture concepts and structures. All other platform artifacts derive from this one and declares it as a dependency.

== HTTP and REST

The `holon-http` artifact provides base *HTTP* protocol support to the Holon platform, dealing with HTTP _messages_ and providing support for _RESTful_ web services invocation through a _client_ API.

[[Auth]]
== Authentication and Authorization

The `holon-auth` artifact provides a complete and highly configurable *Authentication* and *Authorization* architecture, integrated with all platform modules. *HTTP* messages authentication is supported, and several APIs are provided to manage _accounts_ and their credentials, perform authentication in a *Realm* and check for *permissions*.

[[SpringIntegration]]
== Spring framework integration

The `holon-spring` artifact provides integration with the https://spring.io[Spring^] framework and auto-configuration features using https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot^] for the Holon platform core module.

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The following logger names are available:

* `com.holonplatform.core`: the root *core* logger
** `presentation`: for logs related to values presentation
** `i18n`: for logs related to localization and internationalization
** `beans`: for logs related to bean inspection and bean properties
** `property`: for logs related to the `Property` architecture, including `PropertyBox`, property presenters and renderers
** `query`: for logs related to `Query` definition and execution
** `datastore`: for logs related to `Datastore` configuration and operation execution
* `com.holonplatform.jdbc`: for logs related to *JDBC* support classes, such as DataSource builders
* `com.holonplatform.http`: for logs related to *HTTP* support classes, such as `RestClient`
* `com.holonplatform.spring`: for logs related to https://spring.io[Spring^] integration

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform core module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.
