/**
 * A {@link Context} scope to hold, manage and access context resources. Every resource is identified by a
 * {@link String} key.
 * <p>
 * Each scope is identified by a name which must be unique among all registered context scopes and may implement a
 * specific strategy to store and provide resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Every concrete scope must provide the {@link #get(String, Class)} operation. Resource management operations
 * (put/remove) are optional and may not be available, throwing an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A ContextScope must be registered in {@link ContextManager} to be accessibile from {@link Context} fa√ßade and join
 * generic context resource retrieval chain. Scope registration can be performed using default Java extension through
 * {@link ServiceLoader} or directly using {@link ContextManager#registerScope(ClassLoader, ContextScope)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getOrder()} method can be used to assign a order to the scope within the scopes chain for context
 * resource resolution. Lower order values mean highest precedence.
